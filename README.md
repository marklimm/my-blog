This page lists a few projects that I've worked on as well as a few vimeo screencasts that I experimented with.  The content is read from a Sanity (headless CMS) studio instance

**Technology stack:**
- NextJS (static site generation framework)
- React (javascript HTML rendering library :)
- Sanity IO (headless CMS)
- Typescript (typing for javascript)
- Sass (CSS extension)
- Tailwind (CSS library)
- eslint (javascript code linting)
- Prettier (opinionated code style formatting)

**Additional packages used:**
- `groq` (Sanity's query language for retrieving content)
- `@u-wave/react-vimeo` (renders an embedded vimeo video in react)

**Code Linting:**
Code linting is done with the `eslint:recommended`, react recommended and typescript recommended rules.  Prettier is also used with a few custom rule changes

**Deployment:**
This website is deployed on vercel
